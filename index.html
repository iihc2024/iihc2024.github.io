			Building on the success of the earlier timetabling competitions, the <b>Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024</b> intends to stimulate research focusing on the challenges of integrated optimization problems.
			The competition will officially begin 1st September 2024, and will run untill 31 March 2025.
			The award ceremony will take place during EURO 2025 on 22-25 June 2025 in Leeds (UK).			
		</p>
		<p>The considered optimization problem integrates three critical problems in healthcare: surgical case planning, patient admission scheduling and nurse-to-room assignment. <b>The complete problem description and an overview of the competition's rules can be found <a href="assets/files/ihtc2024_problem_specification.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</b></p>

		<p>The top three competitors will receive a cash prize as well as a free registration to EURO 2025.</p>

        <h2>Instances</h2>
        <p>Instances are provided in JSON format with the fixed structure that is described in detail in the <a href="#" target="_blank">specification document</a>. Each instance is contained in a single file. We provide a public dataset composed of 30 instances, named i01, … i30, with a scheduling period ranging from 2 to 4 weeks, and a number of patients ranging from about 50 to about 500. In addition, we provide 5 test instances, test01, … test05 for testing and debugging purposes. For the test dataset, we also provide a solution for each specific instance.</p>
		
		<h5>Test dataset</h5>
		
		<p>The test dataset can be downloaded <a href="assets/files/ihtc2024_test_dataset.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. Solutions for these instances can be found <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The validator that certifies the quality of a given solution is provided as <a href="#" target="_blank">a <span style="font-family: monospace;">C++</span> source code</a> and should be compiled using, for example, the GNU compiler <span style="font-family: monospace;">g++</span>.

		<p>The next section presents the list of occupants, each characterized by a unique id along with their gender group and age_group as well as the duration of their stay length_of_stay. Two arrays indicate the workload_produced, and the skill_level_required for each shift of their stay. Additionally, each occupant is linked to a room_id, specifying their assigned room.</p>

		<p>The patient section includes additional details pertaining to scheduled surgeries. The "mandatory" field denotes whether a patient is required to be scheduled must be scheduled within the given period, while surgery_release_day indicates the earliest day for surgery (and hospital admission). For mandatory patients, the field surgery_due_day signifies the latest possible surgery date, while optional patients do not have this attribute. Further surgery details include the surgery_duration (in minutes) and the pre-assigned surgeon surgeon (surgeon_id).</p>

		<p>Each surgeon has an id and a max_surgery_time list specifying their availability (in minutes) on each day of the scheduling period. Similarly, each operating theater is identified by an id accompanied by an availabilitylist indicating the theater’s availability (in minutes) for each day of the scheduling period. Finally, to each room is associated an id and a capacity (constant during the entire scheduling period).</p>

		<h5>Solution files</h5>
		<p>The solution file format is divided into two sections: one about patients and one about nurses.</p>

		<p>The patient section comprises of the list of admitted patients. For each admitted patient it’s necessary to state their <span style="font-family: monospace;">id</span> their <span style="font-family: monospace;">admission_day</span> as well as the ids representing the room and operating theater they have been assigned to. Non-admitted patients can be either omitted from the solution or be present with the syntax <span style="font-family: monospace;">"admission_day": "none"</span>.</p>

		<p>The nurse section should contain the list of <span style="font-family: monospace;">assignments</span> for each nurse. Each assignment should include the <span style="font-family: monospace;">day</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">shift</span> of the working shift and the list of rooms covered by the nurse. If no rooms are covered, the assignment may be omitted or the list of rooms may be empty. If a nurse does not cover any rooms in any of their work shifts, they can be omitted completely.</p>
